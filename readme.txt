Include Google and OpenStreetMap maps in posts and pages, and map posts, pages, and other objects on global maps. Make WordPress into a GeoCMS.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you save location information with posts, pages, and other WordPress objects. These can then be presented on interactive maps in many ways.

= Key Features =

Geo Mashup, like WordPress, has a simple interface for basic features,
templates for control of output, and APIs for endless customization options.

Some popular features are:

  * Use different map providers: [Google Maps v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference), [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com)
  * Global maps can present your posts in many ways

	They can show just one category, custom taxonomy term, or custom post type, for example

	Clicking on a post marker shows a customizable summary of the post or page in an info window

  * A Geo Search widget enables searching for content by distance from a search location
  * Marker clustering for Google maps
  * Location can be saved for all post types (including pages) users, and comments
  * Synchronize [Geodata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata) with the Geo location mobile client and other plugins
  * Support for both standard WordPress [shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) and [template tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters) to add maps to your site.
  * Reverse geocoding to fill in address information for locations
  * GeoRSS automatically added to feeds
  * Attach KML files to posts and pages
  * Connect category markers with a colored line

If you need features that are aren't listed here, check [the documentation](https://github.com/cyberhobo/wordpress-geo-mashup/wiki/Getting-Started) and the [tag reference](https://github.com/cyberhobo/wordpress-geo-mashup/wiki/Tag-Reference).
