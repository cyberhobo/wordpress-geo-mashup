
These are notes for the software author, to help ensure you don't get a broken release :)

= Before =
	* Feature branches are merged to develop branch
	* TravisCI build is passing
	* New documentation is written

= Release Steps =

If any step fails, fix before continuing, repeating any necessary prior steps.

	1. Start a `release/<version>` branch off `develop`, remember to `git pull` changes`.
	1. Edit WP readme.txt (Remember tested version, and changelog. Stable tag is automated.)
	1. Update the language template if the release contains new language strings `yarn makepot`, `git commit`;
	1. Update version, `yarn version --new-version <new version> --no-git-tag-version`, commit.
	1. Push, check GitHub actions, `git push -u origin release/<version>`
	1. Merge `git checkout master; git merge --no-ff release/<version>; git push`
    1. For major versions generate and deploy any new PHPDoc and JavaDocs. `yarn jsdoc`, `yarn phpdoc`.
    1. Tag and push `git tag <version>; git push --tags`. A GitHub action will deploy to wordpress.org.
    1. Merge back to develop `git co develop; git merge master; git push`
	1. Close milestone, prune issues.
